# news_url_fetcher
Scripts for fetching news URL's with custom key words in newsapi, Euronews, and Africanews.

URL_FETCH_newsapi.py requires newsapi api key. URL_FETCH_euronews.py and URL_FETCH_africanews.py do not require separate keys. Replace the search query string in each script with your own string. After running, a .CSV file with datetime stamp should appear in the same directory with the .py file. .CSV file should include the URL's that point to an article including your query string.
